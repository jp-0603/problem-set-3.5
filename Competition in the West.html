<p>The Warriors have had MUCH success in the past years. The Warriors starting lineup is pretty good as they won three championships in the last 4 years.</p>
<p>Their point guard is a three-point specialist and even some people call him the greatest shooter in the NBA. He is also known for his clutch factor. His name is Stephen Curry. His most famous clutch shot was against the Thunder on February 28, 2016, where he hit a three-pointer from 38 feet. He is also a two-time MVP, which one of them was unanimous.</p>
<p>Klay Thompson is a very accurate three-point shooter. He works very well off the ball, working off of screens and plays. He also complements Stephen Curry.</p>
<p>Kevin Durant was signed to the Warriors on July 4, 2016. The Thunder lost in the 2015-2016 season in the Western Conference Finals to the Warriors. The Thunder were leading the series 3-1 and the Warriors went on a streak to win three games in a row. Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors after the season ended. Many people view him a weak superstar as he went to join the team that beat his team in the playoffs. However, he helped the Warriors to win two rings and has received the Finals MVP Award for both championships.</p>
<p>Draymond Green is a defensive player rather than an offensive player. He is viewed as the most versatile player in the NBA. He can guard all five positions effectively. He also had the first triple-double without recording double-digit points. He had 12 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals on February 10, 2017.</p>
<p>Demarcus Cousins had recently had a torn Achilles on January 27, 2018. It takes 8 to 12 months to fully recover this injury. He was very good before the Achilles injury. He played for the New Orleans Pelicans in the 2017-2018 season alongside Anthony Davis. New Orleans lost in the NBA Western Conference Semifinals to the Warriors with the series being 4-1. Cousins then signed a $5.3 million dollar contract for one year with the Warriors.</p>

<h3> Houston Rockets Lineup </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Chris Paul</li>
	<li>James Harden</li>
	<li>Carmelo Anthony</li>
	<li>P.J Tucker</li>
	<li>Clint Capela</li>
</ul>
	<br>

	<br>
<p> Chris Paul has had a lot of experience in the NBA. He is considered a very IQ player in the NBA. He played alongside another known very high IQ player(James Harden) in the 2017-2018 season. He also works very well with Clint Capela and can find the right man for every play.</p>
<p>James Harden is very skillful on the offensive end. However, his defense is not great but is slowly increasing. NBA players have said his step back was very difficult to guard as it was quick and effective. He won the 2017-2018 MVP and it was very well deserved.</p>
<p>Carmelo Anthony recently has played for the Oklahoma City Thunder but was traded during the offseason. He got waived by the Atlanta Hawks after the trade. He then signed a $2.2 million contract with the Houston Rockets.</p>
<p> P.J Tucker is really good defensively as he is a skilled Veteran. He shoot the corner three very well throughout the season. Other than that, he lacks offensive ability.</p>
<p>Clint Capela really makes the team look good as he has a high field goal percentage. He also finished alley-oops and plays very good defense.</p>
