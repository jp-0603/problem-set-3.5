	The Boston Celtics has become one of the best teams in the past few years. They have obtained Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving in the same offseason. They can be considered two remarkable all-stars. Kyrie Irving has won a championship ring with the Cleveland Cavaliers alongside LeBron James. Gordon Hayward left the team Utah Jazz and joined to uplift his career. He unfortunaly suffferd a injury the season opener on his new team. He did not play the whole season but will most likely play this season opener. They have a young core of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Jayson Tatum is only 20 years old in the NBA and he is doing things people will not see ever again. He has trained with arguebly the msot talented scorer in the league, Kobe Bryant. Jayson tTaum is very long and athletic and has led the Celtics to the playoffs. Jaylen Brown is also a nice complement to the team. Al Horford is a veteran player and he is very versatile. He is considered a strech foward, which means, he can space out the floor. He can also play good defense.</p>

<p> The Toronto Raptors have been hyped during the regular season. However, when the Raptors reach the post season, they lost momentum. The Raptors are considered a joke in the playoffs to many people. There has been a man for that reason and that man is LeBron James. When he was on the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Raptors and Cavaliers would always meet. During the 2017-2018 season, the Cavaliers swept the Raptors even though the Raptors were the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference. The Cavaliers were fourth. LeBron James has left Cleveland during the 2017-2018 season and went to the Los Angles Lakers. The Los Angles Lakers is a Western Conference team and will not meet the Raptors unless for the NBA Finals. This means the Raptors have a winning chance this upcoming season. The Raptors acquired a big superstar in the league, Kawhi Leonard. The Raptors traded away their arguebly greatest Raptor of all-time, DeMar Derozan. Danny Green has also been traded with Kawhi Leonard. He is a very versatile player as he can shoot and play defense.
