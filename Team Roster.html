<div></div>Andre Roberson is the defensive mind on the lineup. He does not do well on offense, but his defense is outstanding. However, Andre Roberson suffered a ruptured left patellar tendon on January 28, 2018. Unfortunately, he did not play in the playoffs and will mis some games for the 2018-2019 season.

<div></div>Patrick Patterson is a nice addition to the Thunder. He is also viewed as a defensive mind and can stretch the floor the other end. Unfortunately, he is not good stats wise.

<div></div>Steven Adams is probably viewed as the most strongest and underrated center in the NBA. He has lead the 2017-2018 season in average offensive rebounds per game. He is also very good at the pick and roll at 7’0.<div></div>
